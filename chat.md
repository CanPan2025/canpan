Used Qoder for code generation.
Used Grok to learn basic web development.

#1
create a landing page for my medical app CanPan, include a white bar at the top that stays at the top when the user scrolls down, use pale yellow, pale orange and pale green as the colour tone, use npm start to test host on localhost 3000

This is the first prompt I made to create the landing page, it created the basic structure of the page with the Home, Features, About and Contact sections, all modifications made onwards used this as a reference.


#2
give some ideas on making the "Our features" section more eye catching

Our team members are unfamiliar with designing websites, the response from the AI gave us some ideas on how to make the website more flavourful instead of the initial bland and generic look.


#3
modify the project so that it can be deployed on vercel and be test previewed with npm start at localhost 3000

This one prompt set up the files needed to both deploy the project on Vercel and be test previewed with npm start at localhost:3000, and gave the suggestion of using gitignore for better management with github. This was very helpful as it eased the development process by preventing the need to repeatedly push and test deploy.
