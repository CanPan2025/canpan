Used Qoder for code generation.


create a landing page for my medical app CanPan, include a white bar at the top that stays at the top when the user scrolls down, use pale yellow, pale orange and pale green as the colour tone, use npm start to test host on localhost 3000

This is the first prompt I made to create the landing page, it created the basic structure of the page with the Home, Features, About and Contact sections, all modifications made onwards used this as a reference.
